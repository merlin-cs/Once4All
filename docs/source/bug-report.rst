These bug reports correspond to RQ1 in our ASPLOS'26 paper.

.. note::

   The tables presented in RQ1 are based on manual analysis of SMT solver issues. As such, we cannot provide exact commands to reproduce the results. However, we include the relevant GitHub issues for each solver, which contain detailed discussions and resolutions of the identified bugs.
